Tissue engineering scaffolds are designed to influence the physical, chemical and biological environment surrounding a cell population. In this review we focus on our own work and introduce a range of strategies and materials used for tissue engineering, including the sources of cells suitable for tissue engineering: embryonic stem cells, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells and cord-derived mesenchymal stem cells. Furthermore, we emphasize the developments in custom scaffold design and manufacture, highlighting laser sintering, supercritical carbon dioxide processing, growth factor incorporation and zoning, plasma modification of scaffold surfaces, and novel multi-use temperature-sensitive injectable materials.  \n",
       "2                                     Enhancement of Forced Convection Subcooled Film Boiling Heat Transfer Using Gas Sheet Collapse by Electric Field Application. Enhancement of forced-convection boiling heat transfer by electriceld is investigated experimentally. When a high-temperature horizontallament is immersed in water, a gas sheet is formed around and the abovelament due to liquid boiling, in the early immersion process. This gas-sheet markedly decreases the boiling cooling rate of thelament. Here, forced collapse of the gas sheet is attempted by imposing an electriceld to enhance the boiling cooling rate, In the experiments, a horizontal platinum wire of 0.5mm in diameter is immersed in pure water under atmospheric pressure, and a DC voltage up to 600V is applied between the wire surface and an electrode made of glass placed 10mm apart. The whole boiling curve is measured under different applied voltages and wire-falling velocities in 0.5 to 2.0m/s range, and at subcooling of 60 K. The experimental results show that the electric field is effective in promoting the disintegration of the gas sheet. Under the tested conditions, boiling cooling rate increased two-fold for an applied electriceld of 600 V/cm. This result shows that the use of an electriceld to break up the gas-sheet has resulted in a remarkable increase in the cooling rate at high superheats during initial cooling period, which is even greater than that used in the existing material manufacturing processes by the rapid cooling method, and therefore, this method may contribute to developing new materials.  \n",

The excavations of Late Lengyel settlement in Racot 18 near Koscian are the most important archaeological achievements of Lech Czerniak in the first period of his outstanding academic career. This large settlement was made of numerous trapezoidal houses and several internal, external, and loam pits associated with them. The work at Racot 18 led to the discovery of a large assemblage of animal bones in an excellent state of preservation. The article examines the characteristics of the sheep and goat-based economy at the settlement of Racot 18. A comprehensive analysis of the caprine bones involved contextually driven faunal studies comprising taphonomy, separating sheep and goats, and kill-off patterns. The work implies a complex system of sheep and goat exploitation that includes the use of specialised harvesting strategies and the exploitation of different food resources, including meat and marrow and secondary products, most likely milk and wool. The significance of this work for recognizing the characteristics of Late Danubian agriculture in the Polish lowlands is also discussed.  \n",

The drag reduction technique involving air cavities under ship hulls is a promising energy-saving technology. Understanding the air cavity dynamics in unsteady conditions and developing methods for the air cavity system optimization are critically important for practical implementation of this technology. In this study, a potential-flow theory is applied for modeling the air cavities under solid walls in water flow with fluctuating pressure. The present modeling approach incorporates detachment of macroscopic air pockets from the cavity tail. For specific configurations considered in this article, it is found that a change of the rate of air supply into the cavity can partly mitigate degradation of the overall power savings by the air cavity system in unsteady conditions.  \n",

Earlier formulations for rib stability when applied to case studies gave very low FOS value suggesting significant ground control problems, which were contrary to the field observations. This has necessitated the need to revisit the concept of rib stability. The stress coming on the rib is estimated with the use of numerical modeling technique using the FLAC3D software. The methodology of assessing rib-stability with the help of suggested rib-strength formulation has been validated at eight Indian coal mines. The outcome of this study finds relevance and importance in ensuring underground coal liquidation with improved safety and conservation.  \n",
       "20996  Accumulation Process of Distant Water Small Trawl in the North Pacific Ocean Estimated on Pocket-net Experiments.. The experimental operations were carried out by a distant water small trawler in the North Pacific Ocean to research accumulation process for walleye pollock Theragra chalcogramma and atka mackerel Pleurogrammus monopterygius in the trawl. Fourteen pocket-nets were attached from wings to the codend to investigate how fish accumulate between the net mouth and the codend. When the pocket-nets were attached over the trawl netting, the pocket-net catches were extremely low, suggesting a blocking effect by the trawl netting for both species. When, the trawl netting was removed from the pocket-net mouth, a catch of the pocket-net was relatively large at the rear part of the trawl for both species. The pocket-net attached at the side panels had a tendency to catch more fish than the pocket-net at the top panel. Two models to express accumulation process were developed from catch results and trawl shape assuming that no fish passed through mesh. Those are; Model 1, Density of fish become higher at the near space of the netting due to the accumulation along the netting; Model 2, Density of fish become higher uniformly in any cross section parts. Correlation between density of fish estimated by Model 1 and catch of the pocket-net was higher than the case of Model 2 for both species. This suggests that the accumulation process was mainly governed by trawl shape and both species were accumulated to the codend along the netting by the taper construction of the trawl.  \n",

At both standards, we examined two types of refereeing decision (sporting and disciplinary) after transgressions that varied in ambiguity.

The hypothesis that referees use standard of competition as a judgemental heuristic, but in varying ways, was supported.  \n",

Enhancement of forced-convection boiling heat transfer by electriceld is investigated experimentally. When a high-temperature horizontallament is immersed in water, a gas sheet is formed around and the abovelament due to liquid boiling, in the early immersion process. This gas-sheet markedly decreases the boiling cooling rate of thelament. Here, forced collapse of the gas sheet is attempted by imposing an electriceld to enhance the boiling cooling rate, In the experiments, a horizontal platinum wire of 0.5mm in diameter is immersed in pure water under atmospheric pressure, and a DC voltage up to 600V is applied between the wire surface and an electrode made of glass placed 10mm apart. The whole boiling curve is measured under different applied voltages and wire-falling velocities in 0.5 to 2.0m/s range, and at subcooling of 60 K. The experimental results show that the electric field is effective in promoting the disintegration of the gas sheet. Under the tested conditions, boiling cooling rate increased two-fold for an applied electriceld of 600 V/cm. This result shows that the use of an electriceld to break up the gas-sheet has resulted in a remarkable increase in the cooling rate at high superheats during initial cooling period, which is even greater than that used in the existing material manufacturing processes by the rapid cooling method, and therefore, this method may contribute to developing new materials.</td>\n",

The excavations of Late Lengyel settlement in Racot 18 near Koscian are the most important archaeological achievements of Lech Czerniak in the first period of his outstanding academic career. This large settlement was made of numerous trapezoidal houses and several internal, external, and loam pits associated with them. The work at Racot 18 led to the discovery of a large assemblage of animal bones in an excellent state of preservation. The article examines the characteristics of the sheep and goat-based economy at the settlement of Racot 18. A comprehensive analysis of the caprine bones involved contextually driven faunal studies comprising taphonomy, separating sheep and goats, and kill-off patterns. The work implies a complex system of sheep and goat exploitation that includes the use of specialised harvesting strategies and the exploitation of different food resources, including meat and marrow and secondary products, most likely milk and wool. The significance of this work for recognizing the characteristics of Late Danubian agriculture in the Polish lowlands is also discussed.</td>\n",

Understanding the air cavity dynamics in unsteady conditions and developing methods for the air cavity system optimization are critically important for practical implementation of this technology. In this study, a potential-flow theory is applied for modeling the air cavities under solid walls in water flow with fluctuating pressure. The present modeling approach incorporates detachment of macroscopic air pockets from the cavity tail. For specific configurations considered in this article, it is found that a change of the rate of air supply into the cavity can partly mitigate degradation of the overall power savings by the air cavity system in unsteady conditions.</td>\n",
